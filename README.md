# Vendors_sales_summary_analysis
Vendor performance analysis project to optimize inventory management, pricing strategies, and profitability. Includes EDA, correlation analysis, inventory turnover insights, bulk purchasing impact, and vendor profitability comparison. Actionable recommendations provided



# Business Problem 

Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing 
profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure 
that they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory 
turnover, or vendor dependency. The goal of this analysis is to: 
  ● Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing 
  adjustments. 
  ● Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit. 
  ● Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs. 
  ● Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve 
  efficiency. 
  ● Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and 
  low-performing vendors.
